        <p> During this experience, I collaborated with a team of six students to develop a comprehensive <b>business plan</b> aimed at helping the National Grid transition toward <b>net zero emissions</b> — all within a challenging time limit of <b>4 hours</b>. </p>
        <p> As the <b>primary group communicator</b>, I took on a leadership role by managing all inquiries, facilitating clear and accurate communication, and ensuring the team remained aligned with our project goals. This enabled us to achieve <b>100% alignment</b> and maintain focus under pressure. </p> 
        <p> We presented our pitch to a panel of judges and an audience of over 20 participating teams, showcasing our plan’s innovation and feasibility. Our team earned an impressive <b>4th place</b> overall. </p>

    <div class="content">
        <p> During my second year at the University of Nottingham, I participated in a year-long <b>Software Development</b> module where we were grouped into teams of eight. We were presented with a list of project briefs, comprising both industry-sponsored and university-led projects, from which we selected our top three preferences. </p> 
        <p> For each chosen project, we created a pitch video showcasing our skills, experiences, and why we were the ideal team for the opportunity. Alongside the video, we participated in interviews with project supervisors, where we further demonstrated our abilities, knowledge, and understanding of the project requirements. This phase involved extensive research into the respective companies and the potential implementation strategies for the projects. </p> 
        <p> Through this competitive process, my team was fortunate to secure the opportunity to collaborate with <b>JCB</b> on developing an <b>AR Fault Detection Software</b> (detailed further in the Projects section). I took on the role of <b>Team Administrator</b>, where my primary responsibilities included ensuring timely submission of project deliverables, organising and delegating tasks, ensuring team members were comfortable with their roles, and resolving any conflicts within the group. </p> 
        <p> During the development process, we adopted a <b>pair programming</b> approach. I contributed significantly by designing the front-end of the application and also participated in the back-end development, allowing me to expand my technical skill set further. </p>

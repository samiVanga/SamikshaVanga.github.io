        <p> During the summer of 2024, I was an intern at Go Reply where i co-developed a <b>proof-of-concept application</b> on the <b>Google Cloud Platform</b> that enables patients and doctors to efficiently manage medical data, visualize complex <b>4D MRI scans</b>, and leverage <b>Generative AI</b> to generate detailed medical reports (more information in the projects section). </p> 
        <p> In addition to the development, I had a personal task where I collaborated with the senior manager to conduct independent research on the companyâ€™s public sector projects. This research was presented in a <b>Google-Go Reply strategy meeting</b>, aimed at identifying and exploring new opportunities in the public sector. Additionally, I performed <b>data analysis</b> to uncover deeper insights, supporting the team in making <b>strategic, data-driven decisions</b>. </p> 
        <p> Through this experience, I developed proficiency in <b>Google Cloud services</b>, advanced <b>data analysis</b>, <b>public speaking</b>, and <b>workspace collaboration</b>. I also honed my skills in <b>project management</b> and effective <b>teamwork</b>, contributing to the successful delivery of project milestones. </p>

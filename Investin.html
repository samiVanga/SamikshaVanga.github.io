        <p>During my time at this internship, I was able to take part in many fun activities some of them included</p>
        <p> Collaborating with a team of aspiring <b>Investment bankers</b> and <b>Software developers</b> to create a unique <b>FinTech application</b> aimed at delivering innovative financial solutions. </p> 
        <p> I led a coding team of 3, focusing on designing a <b>creative and engaging user interface</b> using <b>HTML</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>. My role involved combining user-centric design principles with technical implementation to ensure a seamless user experience. </p> 
        <p> Our project was awarded <b>2nd place</b> out of 40 competing teams, recognizing our unique approach, technical execution, and exceptional teamwork. </p>
        <p> Another experience that stood out to me during this internship was the oppurtunity to visit tesla and learn more about the AI techniques and image recogition features they use in the self driving features of their car, which I found very interesting.</p>
